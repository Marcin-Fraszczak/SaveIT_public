## How to use app:

Main functionality depends on adding everyday expenses as 'transactions'.
Each transaction must have specified:
- date
- value
- counterparty (other side of transaction. for example name of the shop)
- category (like 'food', 'tickets', 'transportation' and so on)
- wallet that gathers transactions (usually one is enough, if you want to separate some transactions from another,you can do so by assigning them to another wallet)

Each item can be modified later, by clicking on its name in an item list view.
Dashboard view allows user to view graphs and summary for each month as well as summary for current wallet.

## Step by step instructions: 
1. Create an account, log in.
2. Add counterparties, cateogries, wallet. You are given one of each by default, but they are not enough.
3. Delete default values, if not needed anymore.
4. You can now add transactions.
